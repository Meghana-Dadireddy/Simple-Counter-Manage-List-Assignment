# Counter & List App

1. This is a small React app where you can increase or decrease a counter.  
2. You can add the current counter value to a list (only if it’s unique).  
3. The list can be sorted in ascending or descending order with one click.  
4. You can remove a single number from the list or clear the whole list.  
5. The design is made using Tailwind CSS for a clean and modern look.  
6. Built with Vite so it runs fast and reloads instantly while coding.  
7. To run locally:  
   - Install packages → `npm install`  
   - Start → `npm run dev`  
8. Can be deployed easily to Vercel by pushing to GitHub and importing the repo on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com).
